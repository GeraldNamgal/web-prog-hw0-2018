Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

The topic of my website is food. It includes various information pertaining to food
throughout.

It contains five different .html pages and you can get from any other page from any
of them.

I used a list on page0.html, page1.html, and references.html. There is a table on
index.html. There are images on page0.html, page1.html, and page2.html.

There is a stylesheet called styles.css and another called sassStyles.css which links
to sassStyles.scss. There are also stylesheets for most of the other html pages.

I used at least five different CSS properties and selectors. I used the #id selector
in indexStyles.css for "eventsTable". I used the .class selector in sassStyles.scss and in
page2Styles.css.

I used the @media query to fix the size of my heading for smaller devices in indexStyles.css
and in page0Styles.css for resizing the picture which was a little too big for smaller
devices.

I used Bootstrap's navigation component for the navigation bar that appears on every
page. I also used three bootstrap columns for formatting the ingredients list on
page0.html and page1.html.

In my sassStyles.scss file I used a variable called "$color", have nested styling,
and have an abstraction for inheritance for to list food ingredients. I used
inheritance to color code different types of recipes in my site. For instance,
ingredients with a green background are for soups and those with a coral background
are for desserts.
