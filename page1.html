        <p> Halo-halo is one of my favorite desserts. It means "to mix" or "a
            mixture" in Tagalog. As such, I can describe it as a mishmash of
            sweet delicacies with milk and ice; sort of like the American gelato
            but with a lot more thrown in. It's really good after any meal especially
            when it's hot outside. It's served with a long spoon in a tall glass
            and part of the fun of eating it is mixing it all together, hence the
            name. I remember my dad scolding me when he saw that I was mixing it
            improperly as a child. He showed me that the secret is to agitate/mix
            from the bottom which proved most effective. It's super easy to make
            and can easily be tailored to your own taste. Also, it's so yummy!

        <p> DIRECTIONS: Add any of the fruit and sweet ingredients of your choice
            to a tall glass. Add the ice. Then pour the milk over the ice and add
            sugar to your liking. Traditionally, the flan and ice creams are put on
            top. Wheat flakes can also be added for an extra layer of texture and
            yummy goodness.
